# OD-MatrixEstimation
this is a project about estimating OD-Matrix Using Optimization and Sparse reconstruction techniques 
two files are attached were one of them are core and basis classes were written over there ! 
file 'Test.ipynb' contains and example ! 

## Method
first we generated a rank one origin destination demand matrix and then affect the matrix with a distance matrix . we 
used the gravity model by which i meand that every region has two masses , one for detraction and one for attraction and we 
have assumed that the demand satisfy the newtonian gravity law framework (awkward assumption right ?!) and then solved the 
user [equilibrium using](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Glen_Wardrop) projection free method . you can find main method 
written in the notebook with more clarity !
